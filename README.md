Initial Version
# Overview
This repository contains the exercises done by this trainning course: https://www.udemy.com/course/bootcamp-blockchain-cero-experto
We will take some notes how to use Remix, configuration, execution of contracts and debug. 
Additional we will include some links about of the Solity language or other additional information or concepts that I believe that is necessary to have it.
As part of this trainning, we ignore the use of Branches, to avoid delay or more confusion. If some file is necesary to change due to part of this trainning course, we will create different versions of the file.
